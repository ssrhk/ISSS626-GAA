<h1>1 Overview</h1>
<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">1.1 Background</h2>
<p>Financial inclusion plays a critical role in fostering equitable economic growth by enabling individuals and businesses to access essential financial services such as banking, loans, equity, and insurance. It is especially important in developing regions where the unbanked population faces limited access to formal financial products, which constrains their ability to save, invest, and secure insurance, leading to income inequality. In this study, we aim to explore the factors that influence financial inclusion at the district level in Tanzania using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) methods.</p>
<p>GWR is a powerful spatial analysis tool that accounts for geographical variability in relationships between predictor variables and financial inclusion, providing localized insights into how different factors affect access to financial services across districts.</p>

<section id="objectives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives">1.2 Objectives</h2>
<p>The primary goal of this analysis is to identify and examine the key indicators of financial inclusion in Tanzania.</p>
