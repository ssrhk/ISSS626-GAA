Hi there!

I'm Sei Sar, a Master of IT in Business student at SMU.

This website showcases my journey in learning Geospatial Analytics during my third semester under the guidance of Professor Kam Tim Seong. The course includes Hands-on Exercises, In-class Exercises, and Take Home Assignments that offer practical experience and deepen my understanding of this exciting new field Iâ€™m exploring.

I developed this site using R-Studio. Feel free to explore my work on my GitHub repository: [ssrhk/ISSS626-GAA](https://github.com/ssrhk/ISSS626-GAA).

If you enjoy my work, let's connect on Linkedin: [(25) Sei Sar \| LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seisarhlakyi/)
