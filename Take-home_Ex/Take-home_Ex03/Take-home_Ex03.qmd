# 1 Overview

## 1.1 Background

Financial inclusion plays a key role in promoting equitable economic growth by enabling individuals and businesses to access essential financial services such as banking, loans, insurance, and equity products. In Tanzania, financial inclusion initiatives have become a priority in addressing the needs of underserved populations, particularly those in rural or economically disadvantaged areas. These initiatives aim to improve household incomes, reduce income inequality, and foster inclusive economic participation by providing timely and affordable access to financial products and services(United Nations Capital Development Fund \[UNCDF\], 2024).

Despite significant progress in financial inclusion efforts, access to financial services is uneven across different geographical regions within Tanzania. Rural areas, particularly in districts with low levels of economic activity, often face greater challenges in accessing financial services compared to more urbanized districts. These spatial disparities raise important questions about the factors driving financial inclusion at the district level and how regional policies can be designed to promote more inclusive economic outcomes.

## 1.2 Objectives

This analysis aims to build an explanatory model using Multiple Linear Regression as well as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to identify the key factors affecting financial inclusion across districts in Tanzania. By focusing on multiple socio-economic and infrastructural variables, this study will provide insights into how these factors vary geographically and influence financial access ***at a district level***.

Specifically, the objectives are:

-   **Identify Key Determinants**: Determine the primary socio-economic and infrastructural factors that influence financial inclusion.

-   **Examine Regional Variation**: Explore how the effects of these factors vary across different districts, providing a localized understanding of financial inclusion.

# 2 Methodology

The explanatory model will be developed first using **Multiple Linear Regression** and **Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)**, which is a spatial extension of multiple linear regression that allows for localized variations in the relationships between predictors and the response variable—in this case, financial inclusion.

The process will follow these steps:

-   **Defining dependent variable (y)**: Derive dependent variable which represents financial inclusion from the FinScope dataset.

-   **Explanatory Variable Selection (x)**: Identify key predictor variables, both continuous and categorical, from the FinScope dataset. These will serve as explanatory variables in the model.

-   **Model Building**: Build the explanatory model using multiple linear regression techniques, enhanced by GWR to account for geographical variations. This will allow us to evaluate the influence of each predictor on financial inclusion across different districts.

-   **Model Calibration and Validation**: Calibrate the model to ensure that it effectively captures the localized relationships between financial inclusion and its determinants.

-   **Spatial Visualization**: Mapping the results of the GWR model to visualize how the effects of each factor vary geographically, will highlight districts where specific variables have a stronger or weaker influence on financial inclusion.

# 4 Importing the Data

## 4.1 The Datasets

For this analysis, we will use two primary datasets: (1) FinScope Tanzania 2023, which provides district-level data on financial inclusion, and (2) district-level boundary GIS data from the geoBoundaries portal to facilitate spatial analysis.

-   **FinScope Tanzania 2023**: This dataset include comprehensive district-level data on access to financial services, covering indicators such as banking services, mobile money usage, savings, loans, and insurance. The dataset will be used to identify the key factors affecting financial inclusion and to develop the explanatory model.

-   **District Boundary GIS Data**: Geographic boundary data for the districts of Tanzania, sourced from the geoBoundaries, will enable us to link the financial inclusion data to specific geographic locations for spatial analysis using GWR.

## 4.2 Aspatial Data

The *FinScope* *Tanzania* dataset from 2023, was imported by using *read_csv()* package.

Then, the data was prepared for analysis with the following steps:

-   We extract the columns with the variables chosen which will be explained in the Variable Selection section.
-   Rename some district names to match the boundary dataset in section 4.3.
-   Remove columns with all missing/NA values.

```{r}
#| eval: False
tanzania <- read_csv("data/rawdata/FinScope_Tanzania.csv") %>%
  select(5, 9, 11, 13:14,16, 65:67, 95:103, 107:119, 125, 
         140, 142:151, 160:174, 177:178, 180, 183:192, 196, 215:223, 
         275:278, 294:306, 344:353, 361:372, 374:378, 395:397, 455:460, 
         495, 497, 507:529, 574:580, 591, 612, 650:651, 653, 655, 657, 
         678, 680:685, 697:698, 702:716, 718) %>%
  mutate(dist_name = ifelse(dist_name == "Magharibi A", "Magharibi", dist_name),
         dist_name = ifelse(dist_name == "Magharibi B", "Magharibi", dist_name),
         dist_name = ifelse(dist_name == "Nyang'hwale", "Nyanghwale", dist_name),
         dist_name = ifelse(dist_name == "Wanging'ombe", "Wangingombe", dist_name))%>%
  select(where(~ !all(is.na(.))))
```

We will use ***glimpse()*** to quickly check the attributes.

```{r}
#| eval: False
glimpse(tanzania)
```

Lastly, we will save the prepared dataframe into rds format.

::: panel-tabset
## Save

```{r}
#| eval: False
write_rds(tanzania, "data/rds/tanzania.rds")
```

## Load

```{r}
tanzania <- read_rds("data/rds/tanzania.rds")
```

## 4.3 Geospatial Data - Study Area

The *geo Boundaries of Tanzania* dataset, was imported by using *st_read()* package.

The dataset was prepared for analysis with the following steps:

-   We note that Tanzania is in WGS 84/ UTM Zone 37S. We will use st_transform to reproject coordinate reference system to EPSG: 32737 for Tanzania.

-   To perform left join with the aspatial dataset, we need a common column - districts name. Therefore, we need to change the variable, shapeName, to 'dist_name' to make it a common variable with the FinScope Tanzania dataset.

-   To ensure the districts are common, some districts will be renamed from "Arusha Urban" to "Arusha" as the same way it was displayed in FinScope Tanzania dataset. Since the FinScope Tanzania dataset already have a variable that classifies if the surveyee is residing in an urban or rural area, we do not need to have a separate district with the title Urban as it falls under the same district.

-   We will also remove some district names that are not present in the FinScope Tanzania dataset.

```{r}
tanzbounds <- st_read(dsn = "data/rawdata/", 
                      layer = "geoBoundaries-TZA-ADM2",
                      crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs=32737) %>%
  rename(dist_name = shapeName) %>%
  mutate(dist_name = ifelse(dist_name == "Arusha Urban", "Arusha", dist_name)) %>%

  mutate(dist_name = ifelse(dist_name == "Sumbawanga Urban", "Sumbawanga", dist_name))%>%
  mutate(dist_name = ifelse(dist_name == "Tabora Urban", "Tabora", dist_name))%>%
  mutate(dist_name = ifelse(dist_name == "Tanga Urban", "Tanga", dist_name)) %>%
  mutate(dist_name = ifelse(dist_name == "Nyang'hwale", "Nyanghwale", dist_name)) %>%
  mutate(dist_name = ifelse(dist_name == "Wanging'ombe", "Wangingombe", dist_name)) %>%
  mutate(dist_name = ifelse(dist_name == "Butiam", "Butiama", dist_name)) %>%
  filter(!dist_name %in% c("Mafinga Township Authority", "Kasulu Township Authority", "Masasi  Township Authority" , "Makambako Township Authority", "Kahama Township Authority", "Korogwe Township Authority", "Handeni Mji","Mafia","Tunduma","Korogwe")) %>%
  select (-c("shapeISO","shapeID","shapeGroup","shapeType"))
```

To ensure the study area is in the correct format, we will use ***st_crs*** to check.

```{r}
st_crs(tanzbounds)
```

Now we are ready to save the dataset.

::: panel-tabset
## Save

```{r}
#| eval: False

# 5 Data Wrangling

In the development of a multiple linear regression model, the selection of appropriate variables is critical to ensuring the model's accuracy and interpretability. This section focuses on the selection of both categorical and continuous variables that will serve as predictors in our regression analysis.

Initially, we will establish a preliminary set of variables based on theoretical foundations and previous empirical research from the 722 variables of FinScope Tanzania dataset.

## 5.1 Categorical Variables

We will employ one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables into a format suitable for regression modeling. One-hot encoding allows us to create binary columns for each category, enabling the regression model to assess the impact of each nominal variable effectively. This approach ensures that we capture the distinct effects of categorical factors on the dependent variable while maintaining the integrity of the data.

Before we further prepare our variables (which are in the form of survey questions), we will convert the column names into a more R-friendly format using `make.names()`.

```{r}
#| eval: False
colnames(tanzania) <- make.names(colnames(tanzania))
```

We will use the following variables and code chunk to one-hot encode all the nominal variables as mentioned above. Some one hot encoded columns will be used to derive continuous variables as well.

## 5.2 Continuous Variables

The following are the continuous variables for our initial model:

+----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **Variable**                                 | **Justification for Selection**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | District Level (Group by)                             |
+==============================================+==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+=======================================================+
| Age                                          | Age is a critical demographic variable that often influences various socio-economic outcomes. It can affect financial behaviors, access to resources, and the types of assistance individuals might require.Research indicates that younger individuals may be more inclined to take risks and invest in education or business ventures, while older individuals might focus on savings and retirement planning                                                                                              | Mean Age at each district                             |

| Amount Owed                                  | The Amount Owed is a crucial indicator of an individual's financial obligations and overall debt situation, which directly impacts financial inclusion and well-being. High levels of debt can signal financial distress and can limit individuals' ability to access additional credit or financial services. Understanding the average amount owed at the district level helps identify areas where residents may be over-leveraged, affecting their financial stability and decision-making capabilities. | Mean Amount Owed at each district                     |
+----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Money Spent on Betting                       | Studies show that excessive gambling can lead to financial distress and lower overall financial health (Koomson et al., 2022). Lower spending may lead to better financial health and inclusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Mean Money Spent on Betting at each district          |
+----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Number of Saving Groups respondent belong to | Higher participation in savings groups typically correlates with better savings rates and financial stability. Groups provide social support and financial education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Total Number of Savings Group at each district        |

| Contribution to Saving Groups                | Regular contributions can lead to increased savings and financial stability, improving access to credit and financial services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Total Contribution to Saving Groups for each district |
+----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

For these four continuous variables, we will prepare the data in the following steps:

-   Rename the variables

-   Replace NA values with 0, Except for Age (Age 0 does not make logical sense, Therefore the missing ones will be replaced with the mean_age of the whole dataset excluding NA values which is 39)

    ```{r}
    mean_age <- mean(tanzania$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
    mean_age
    ```

-   Ensure they are in numeric format

-   Remove 3 observations that states that they belong to 150000, 16000 and 2000 social groups which are outliers.

-   Derive the district level variable

```{r}
#| eval: False
tanzania <- tanzania %>%
  mutate(
    Age = as.numeric(replace_na(as.numeric(as.character(Age)), 39)),
    Amount_Owed = as.numeric(replace_na(as.numeric(as.character(G.2.6..Approximately.how.much.money.do.you.owe..in.TZS)), 0)),
    Amount_Betting = as.numeric(replace_na(as.numeric(as.character(X17c.On.average..how.much.do.you.spend.on.betting.in.a.month.)), 0)),
    Group_Belong = as.numeric(replace_na(as.numeric(as.character(X4.3.How.many.savings.groups.do.you.belong.to.in.total.)), 0)),
    Group_Contribution = as.numeric(replace_na(as.numeric(as.character(X4.8.How.much.do.you.contribute.in.total..to.all.the.groups.you.belong..in.a.mont)), 0))) %>%
    filter(!Group_Belong %in% c(150000,16000,2000))
```

```{r}
#| eval: False
continuous_var <- tanzania %>%
  group_by(dist_name) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE), 
    Mean_AmountOwed = mean(Amount_Owed, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_AmountBetting = mean(Amount_Betting, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_GroupBelong = sum(Group_Belong, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_GroupContribution = sum(Group_Contribution, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

We will combine the categorical and continuous variable dataframe to derive the final dataframe.

```{r}
#| eval: False
tanzania_combined <- categorical_var %>%
  left_join(continuous_var, by = "dist_name")
```

## 5.3 Left Join

Next, we will create a layer by left joining the geospatial dataframe (tanzbound) to the attribute dataframe (tanzania) by using ***left_join()***.

::: callout-note
## To perform a left_join(), we must ensure that there is a common column between the two. For our case, the common column is 'dist_name'
:::

```{r}
#| eval: False
tanzania_cleaned <- left_join(tanzbounds,tanzania_combined)
```

We noted that the geometry column is in MULTIPOLYGON format. For GWR analysis later on, we will need point geometries to represent specific locations. Leaving the geometry as MULTIPOLYGON can negatively affect the GWR analysis, as the model requires precise locations for its local regression estimations.We will use st_centroid to find the centroid points of each district.

```{r}
#| eval: False
tanzania_cleaned$centroids <- st_centroid(tanzania_cleaned$geometry)
tanzania_cleaned <- tanzania_cleaned %>%
  mutate(geometry = centroids) %>%
  select(-centroids)
```

```{r}
#| eval: False
write_rds(tanzania_cleaned,"data/rds/tanzania_cleaned")
```

```{r}
tanzania_cleaned <- read_rds("data/rds/tanzania_cleaned")
```

We will visualize the points with **tmap** to ensure they are properly placed (not in water).

```{r}
tmap_mode('plot')
tm_shape(tanzbounds) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "lightblue", border.col = "black") +
  tm_shape(tanzania_cleaned$geometry) + 
  tm_dots(size = 0.03, col = "red") +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Centroids of Districts in Tanzania", 
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    title.size = 0.8
  )
```

## 6 The Dependent Variable

### **6.1.1 Financial Inclusion in Tanzania**

Financial inclusion refers to the process of ensuring that individuals and businesses have access to affordable and useful financial products and services that meet their needs—ranging from transactions, payments, savings, and credit to insurance. According to the World Bank, financial inclusion is a "key enabler in reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity by providing the unbanked and underserved populations access to essential financial services" (World Bank, 2023).

A robust financial inclusion system allows individuals to manage risks, invest in education, and build sustainable livelihoods. In Tanzania, financial inclusion is especially critical for rural populations, where access to traditional banking infrastructure is limited. Many rely on informal financial services, which can hinder their ability to seize economic opportunities. The growth of digital financial services, particularly mobile money, has dramatically expanded financial inclusion across Sub-Saharan Africa, enabling millions to access financial products without needing to visit a physical bank (World Bank Group, 2024).

Despite significant progress, the uneven distribution of financial services between rural and urban areas underscores the need to examine the factors driving financial inclusion at a local level. Understanding these determinants is essential for enhancing access to financial services and fostering inclusive economic development. This study aims to derive a dependent variable representing financial inclusion from the FinScope dataset, focusing on key financial behaviors.

### **6.1.2 Deriving The Dependent Variable - Financial Inclusion Index**

Research by Demirgüç-Kunt and Klapper (World Bank,2018) indicates that financial inclusion is multi-dimensional, encompassing access to credit, savings, and various financial services. Composite indices, such as the Global Financial Inclusion Index, often aggregate multiple financial behaviors to capture the complexity of financial inclusion.

The **Financial Participation and Access Index (FPAI)** is a composite measure that captures the extent of financial inclusion by aggregating various financial service utilizations across multiple sources. By averaging the proportions of individuals engaged with formal banking institutions, microfinance institutions (MFIs), pension plans, insurance products, savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs), capital market fund managers, formal investments, community-managed groups (CMGs), informal moneylenders, and social groups, the FPAI provides a holistic view of financial participation. This comprehensive approach reflects not only access to formal financial services but also the utilization of informal financial mechanisms, which are critical for households that may be underserved by traditional banking. Therefore, the FPAI effectively represents financial inclusion as it quantifies the diversity and breadth of financial engagements within the community, highlighting both formal and informal avenues that contribute to economic resilience and stability.

$FPAI_i=(Banked_i+MFI_i+PENSION_i+INSURANCE_i+SACCO_i+CAPITALM FUND MANAGERS_i+FORM INVESTMENTS_i+CMG_i+INFORMALMONEYLENDER_i+SOCIALGROUPS_i​)/10$

where:

-   $Banked_i$ = Portion of individuals of that particular district i involved in formal banking institutions

-   $MFI​_i$ = Portion of individuals of that particular district i involved in MFI

-   $PENSION_i$= Portion of individuals of that particular district i involved in pension

-   $INSURANCE_i$= Portion of individuals of that particular district i involved in insurance

-   $SACCO_i$= Portion of individuals of that particular district i involved in SACCO

-   $CAPITALMFUNDMANAGERS_i$= Portion of individuals of that particular district i involved with capital fund managers

-   $FORMINVESTMENT_i$= Portion of individuals of that particular district i involved in formal investments

-   $CMG_i$= Portion of individuals of that particular district i involved in CMG

-   $INFORMALMONEYLENDER_i$= Portion of individuals of that particular district i involved with informal money lender

-   $SOCIALGROUPS_I$= Portion of individuals of that particular district i involved in social groups

```{r}
tanzania_cleaned <- tanzania_cleaned %>%
  mutate(FPAI = (Banked + MFI + PENSION + INSURANCE + SACCO +
                 CAPITALM_FUND_MANAGERS + FORM_INVESTMENTS + CMG +
                 INFORMAL_MONEYLENDER + SOCIAL_GROUPS) / 10)
```

### 6.1.3 Dependent Variable Implications

-   **Higher FPAI Values:**

    -   A higher FPAI indicates greater financial inclusion, suggesting that individuals have access to and utilize a diverse range of financial services. This can include formal banking, microfinance institutions (MFIs), pensions, insurance, savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs), capital fund managers, formal investments, and social groups.

    -   Individuals with a higher FPAI are more likely to have better financial security, increased savings, and enhanced opportunities for investment and wealth accumulation. This can also indicate a stronger ability to cope with financial shocks and increased participation in economic activities.

-   **Lower FPAI Values:**

    -   On the other hand, a lower FPAI suggests limited access to financial services, which may reflect a higher level of financial exclusion. Individuals with lower scores may rely primarily on informal financial sources, such as informal moneylenders or social groups, which can expose them to higher risks and less favorable financial conditions.

    -   Low FPAI values can indicate potential barriers to financial inclusion, such as lack of financial literacy, limited access to formal financial institutions, or socio-economic challenges. This can lead to vulnerability in managing financial needs, lower savings rates, and decreased investment opportunities, potentially perpetuating cycles of poverty.

# 7 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step allowing us to uncover underlying patterns and identify anomalies in our cleaned dataset. EDA not only aids in formulating hypotheses but also guides feature selection and model building, ensuring that the subsequent analysis is robust and meaningful. In this section, we will explore our dataset through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis to derive insights that can inform our understanding of financial inclusion in Tanzania.

## 7.2 Correlation Analysis

Since we have around 160 variables chosen, it is hard to visualize a correlation matrix. Therefore we will just display the highly correlated(pairs of variables with absolute correlations greater than 0.8) with the following code chunk.

```{r}
#| eval: False
nogeom_df <- as.data.frame(st_drop_geometry(tanzania_cleaned))

cor_data <- nogeom_df %>%

  Var2 = colnames(cor_matrix)[high_correlations[, 2]],
  Correlation = cor_matrix[high_correlations]
)

# 8 Multiple Linear Regression

## 8.1 Initial Model

We will construct our initial model using these derived variables and use summary() to check the initial model's explanatory power.

```

## Summary

```{r}
summary(tanzania.mlr)
```
:::

The initial model has an adjusted R-squared value of 0.813, meaning that approximately 81% of the variation in the Financial Participation and Access Index (FPAI) is explained by these predictors.

::: callout-note
## In multiple linear regression, adjusted R-squared is prioritized over R-squared because it adjusts for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate assessment of model fit. Unlike R-squared, adjusted R-squared penalizes unnecessary predictors, helping to prevent overfitting and offering a more reliable measure of predictive power.
:::

## 8.2 The Refined Model - Stepwise Regression

In this section, we perform **stepwise regression** for variable selection. This method systematically includes or excludes variables based on specific criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Stepwise regression refines the model by retaining only those predictors that significantly contribute to explaining variations in the Financial Inclusion Index, leading to a more parsimonious and interpretable model.

Through this process, the multiple linear regression model is optimized to identify the key factors impacting FPAI while addressing multicollinearity and ensuring model stability. This approach ultimately enhances the model's explanatory power, enabling more accurate and actionable insights into the drivers of financial inclusion.

::: callout-note
## Criteria for Variable Selection: Reject p-value greater than alpha value of 0.05
:::

We will use the `olsrr` package to do this. The `olsrr` package in R provides a streamlined process for diagnosing multicollinearity issues, performing variable selection, and generating organized model assessment reports. This stage is critical for refining our initial model, ensuring each retained variable significantly contributes to explaining the dependent variable, the FPAI.

Since p value is our defined criteria, we use ***ols_step_forward_p()*** as shown below.

```{r}
tanzania_vs_mlr <- ols_step_forward_p(tanzania.mlr, p_val= 0.05, details=FALSE)
```

```{r}
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 10
plot(tanzania_vs_mlr)
```

The stepwise regression analysis streamlined the initial variable set to 31 significant predictors, as illustrated in the accompanying plots. This selection process resulted in an increase in the model's adjusted R-squared value, which increased from 0.813 in the initial model to 0.830 in the final model. It suggests a greater proportion of the variance in the **Financial Participation and Access Index** (FPAI) explained by the chosen predictors.

The final model with the final variables selected by stepwise regression is represented as the following code chunk.

```{r}
final_tanzania.mlr<- lm(FPAI ~ FinancialEducation_YesNo_Ratio + Total_GroupContribution + 
    Old_Pension + BorrowedFrom_MobileMoney + Other_Insurance_Products + 
    ConfidentWithSavingsGroups + 
    SoldLivestock + Mean_AmountOwed + Mean_Age + ConfidentWithSACCOs + 
    ConfidentWithUTTs + OtherIncome + ConfidentWithFamilyFriends + 
    Mean_AmountBetting + Places_Not_In_My_Area + DontKnowHow + 
    CertofOccupancy + Personal_Accident_Insurance + 
    Agent_Absent + Advice_NoOne + Private_Health_Insurance + 
    Urban + Traders_non_agricultural_Income + Used_POS + Used_AZAMPay + 
    Lost_Money + TooComplicated + Household_Not_On_Register, 
                     data = tanzania_cleaned)
```

## 8.3 Variable Selected

Lastly, we will use the ***tbl_regression()*** from gtsummary package to create publication-ready summary tables in R.

[*Results of Multiple Linear Regression for Impact of Selected Variables on **Financial Participation and Access Index** (FPAI)*]{.underline}

```{r}
#| echo: False
tbl_regression(final_tanzania.mlr, 
               intercept = TRUE,
               estimate_fun = purrr::partial(style_sigfig, digits = 4)) %>% 
  add_glance_source_note(
    label = list(sigma ~ "\U03C3"),
    include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, 
                AIC, statistic,
                p.value, sigma)
  )
```

Interpretation of each predictor:

-   **Intercept**: This is the base FPAI value when all other predictors are zero. The nearly zero intercept suggests that FPAI could be intrinsically low when controlling for all other variables. This minimal intercept might reflect baseline conditions where limited or no access to financial resources, products, or education is common.

-   **FinancialEducation_YesNo_Ratio (β = 0.0502)**: Strongly positive, indicating that higher financial education rates correlate with higher financial participation.

-   **Total_GroupContribution (β ≈ 0.0000)**: Although the coefficient rounds to zero, a very small positive effect suggests that higher social group contributions might slightly increase financial access.

-   **Old_Pension (β = 0.0092)**: Indicates that receiving a pension is associated with higher FPAI, likely due to increased financial stability.

-   **BorrowedFrom_MobileMoney (β = 0.0032)**: Positive association suggests that borrowing through mobile money services supports financial access and participation.

-   **Other_Insurance_Products (β = 0.0077)**: Positive, indicating that access to various insurance products promotes financial inclusion.

-   **ConfidentWithSavingsGroups (β = 0.0014)**: Positive, implying that trust in savings groups encourages financial participation.

-   **SoldLivestock (β = -0.0008)**: Negative, which may indicate that reliance on livestock sales for income is linked to lower access to financial products.

-   **Mean_AmountOwed (β ≈ 0.0000)**: Small positive effect, suggesting that slightly higher amounts owed might not significantly impact FPAI.

-   **Mean_Age (β = 0.0010)**: Small positive effect, with older individuals perhaps having better financial access due to accumulated wealth or experience.

-   **ConfidentWithSACCOs (β = -0.0021)**: Negative, which could mean limited financial inclusion among SACCO members if these are viewed as less formal or high-risk.

-   **ConfidentWithUTTs (β = 0.0014)**: Positive, indicating that trust in UTTs (Unit Trusts) may contribute positively to FPAI.

-   **OtherIncome (β = 0.0043)**: Positive, showing that diversified income sources support greater financial access.

-   **ConfidentWithFamilyFriends (β = -0.0004)**: Slightly negative, suggesting that relying on family or friends for financial guidance might limit broader financial engagement.

-   **Mean_AmountBetting (β ≈ 0.0000)**: No meaningful impact; betting doesn’t significantly influence FPAI.

-   **Places_Not_In_My_Area (β = -0.0008)**: Negative, implying that access to financial product is limited if financial institutions are not in areas where respondents reside, which may imply Tanzania still have room to improve infrastructure to include more financial institutions.

-   **DontKnowHow (β = 0.0018)**: Positive, suggesting that people uncertain about financial practices might still engage with financial systems, possibly through informal means.

-   **CertofOccupancy (β = 0.0018)**: Positive, indicating that having official occupancy certification increases financial access.

-   **Personal_Accident_Insurance (β = 0.0169)**: Positive, showing that accident insurance coverage is associated with increased financial participation.

-   **Agent_Absent (β = 0.0007)**: Positive; absence of agents may encourage independent financial engagement, possibly via mobile or digital channels.

-   **Advice_NoOne (β = -0.0007)**: Negative, implying that lacking financial advice limits engagement with financial products.

-   **Private_Health_Insurance (β = 0.0086)**: Positive, indicating that private health insurance access supports financial inclusion.

-   **Urban (β = 0.0301)**: Strongly positive, with urban residency associated with higher FPAI, likely due to better access to financial services.

-   **Traders_non_agricultural_Income (β = -0.0014)**: Negative, suggesting that informal trading income may limit access to formal financial services.

-   **Used_POS (β = -0.0032)**: Negative, potentially indicating that POS usage alone does not enhance financial access.

-   **Used_AZAMPay (β = 0.0019)**: Positive, suggesting that AZAMPay use correlates with higher financial participation.

-   **Lost_Money (β = -0.0030)**: Negative, possibly reflecting decreased trust or resource loss, reducing financial access.

-   **TooComplicated (β = 0.0024)**: Positive; perceiving financial processes as complex doesn’t necessarily discourage financial engagement.

-   **Household_Not_On_Register (β = -0.0127)**: Negative, highlighting that lack of formal registration negatively impacts financial access.

The predictors, especially those with larger positive coefficients like **FinancialEducation_YesNo_Ratio** (0.0502) and **Urban** (0.0301), reveal impactful areas where improvements could directly boost FPAI and financial inclusion. Similarly, variables with negative coefficients, like **Household_Not_On_Register** (-0.0127), suggest barriers that significantly limits access to financial products and would require attention to enhance inclusion.

## 8.5 Model Diagnostics

### **8.5.1 Multicollinearity - VIF**

Given the large number of variables and low Adjusted R-squared, multicollinearity becomes a concern. High Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) scores indicate that some variables may be highly correlated with one another, which can distort the model's estimates and inflate standard errors. By calculating the VIF for each predictor, we can identify those with excessive multicollinearity—typically with VIF values above 10, suggesting that they should be either removed or consolidated to improve model stability.

```{r}
ols_vif_tol(final_tanzania.mlr)
```

After stepwise regression and significant variables were selected, we can see that there is no VIF greater than 10, indicating no multicollinearity is present in our refined model. High VIF values are only expected in the initial model because our dataframe contains numerous variables capturing related aspects of financial inclusion, such as various forms of access to financial services, borrowing behaviors, and support sources, many of which are conceptually similar and share underlying patterns.

### 8.5.2 Test for Non Linearity

Testing for non-linearity assesses whether the relationship between the predictor variables and the FPAI deviates from a straight line, as linear regression assumes a linear relationship. If non-linearity is present, the residuals will show systematic patterns rather than a random scatter. Testing for non-linearity ensures that the model captures the true relationships within the data and improves predictive accuracy.

```{r}
ols_plot_resid_fit(tanzania_vs_mlr$model)
```

From the figure above, we can confirm that residuals are non linear.

### 8.5.3 Test for Normality Assumption

The normality assumption in linear regression pertains to the distribution of residuals, not the predictor variables. Residuals should follow a normal distribution for valid inference in terms of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. If residuals are not normally distributed, transformations or robust regression techniques may be needed to satisfy the assumption, ensuring reliable and accurate estimates.

```{r}
ols_plot_resid_hist(tanzania_vs_mlr$model)
```

From the figure above, we can confirm that residuals are normally distributed.

### 8.5.3 Test for Spatial Autocorrelation

Testing for spatial autocorrelation is crucial when working with geographically clustered data, as it assesses whether residuals are correlated across spatial locations. Spatial autocorrelation implies that observations close in space may influence each other, violating the independence assumption in linear regression. Moran’s I statistic will be used to detect spatial autocorrelation in residuals.

First we will extract the residuals from the model.

```{r}
mlr_output <- as.data.frame(tanzania_vs_mlr$model$residuals)%>%
  rename ('VS_MLR_RES' = 'tanzania_vs_mlr$model$residuals')
```

Then we will use **cbind** (since there is no unique identifier) to join the newly created df of residuals with our point feature data.frame, tanzania_cleaned, to plot the distribution.

```{r}
tanzania_cleaned <- cbind(tanzania_cleaned,
                         mlr_output$VS_MLR_RES) %>%
  rename ('MLR_RES'='mlr_output.VS_MLR_RES')
```

```{r}
tmap_mode('plot')
tm_shape (tanzbounds) +
  tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE) +
  tm_polygons(alpha=0.4) +
tm_shape(tanzania_cleaned)+
  tm_dots(col= 'MLR_RES',
          alpha = 1,
          style= 'quantile')
```

From the figure above, we can see that there seem to not be a cluster and the residuals are rather random.

#### 8.5.3.1 Spatially Stationary Test

To confirm this and measure the degree to which similar or dissimilar values are clustered in space, we will performing Global Moran’s I. If the indicators are independent of space, Moran’s I should show no significant spatial autocorrelation. The following is the hypothesis that we would like to test.

-   **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The FPAI residuals distribution is spatially independent (randomly distributed in space).

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1) :** There is spatial dependence, indicating that similar values are clustered or dispersed.

The 95% confident interval will be used. (Significance level of 0.05)

We will first compute distance based weights with ***st_knn*** and ***st_weights*** as shown below.

```{r}
tanzania_cleaned <- tanzania_cleaned %>%
  mutate (nb = st_knn(geometry, k = 6,
                      longlat= FALSE),
          wt = st_weights(nb,
                          style = 'W'),
          .before = 1)
```

Then we are ready to perform Global Moran I with 100 simulations using ***global_moran_perm.***

```{r}
global_moran_perm(tanzania_cleaned$MLR_RES,
                  tanzania_cleaned$nb,
                  tanzania_cleaned$wt,
                  alternative = "two.sided",
                  nsim=99)
```

Since p value (0.76) is greater than 0.05, we will not reject the null hypothesis. This implies that the residuals are randomly distributed.

Since observed Global Moran I is less than 0, we infer that the residuals do not resemble cluster distribution.

# 9 Geographically Weighted Linear Regression

# Hedonic Pricing using GWmodel

## Adaptive Bandwidth GWR Model

```{r}
bw_adaptive <- bw.gwr(formula = FPAI ~ FinancialEducation_YesNo_Ratio + Total_GroupContribution + 
    Old_Pension + BorrowedFrom_MobileMoney + Other_Insurance_Products + 
    ConfidentWithSavingsGroups + 
    SoldLivestock + Mean_AmountOwed + Mean_Age + ConfidentWithSACCOs + 
    ConfidentWithUTTs + OtherIncome + ConfidentWithFamilyFriends + 
    Mean_AmountBetting + Places_Not_In_My_Area + DontKnowHow + 
    CertofOccupancy + Personal_Accident_Insurance + 
    Agent_Absent + Advice_NoOne + Private_Health_Insurance + 
    Urban + Traders_non_agricultural_Income + Used_POS + Used_AZAMPay + 
    Lost_Money + TooComplicated + Household_Not_On_Register,
                      data = tanzania_cleaned, 
                      approach="CV", 
                      kernel="gaussian", 
                      adaptive=TRUE, 
                      longlat=FALSE)
```

The adaptive bandwidth values (e.g., 106, 73, 126, 139) control the number of neighboring points included in each localized regression. Each bandwidth produced a Cross-Validation (CV) score, with lower scores indicating a better model fit. Here, an adaptive bandwidth of 139 neighbors provided the lowest CV score (0.02551), suggesting it best balances model accuracy with spatial variability across the regions studied.

## This function really need the model, won't work without model.

Then we compute the GWR.

                      data = tanzania_cleaned, 
                          bw=bw_adaptive, 
                          kernel = 'gaussian', 
                          adaptive=TRUE,

Using the localized model, the model performance goes up all the way to 0.95 for some particularly locations.

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(tanzbounds)+
  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +
tm_shape(gwr_sf_adaptive) +  
  tm_dots(col = "Local_R2",
          border.col = "gray",
          border.lwd = 1) +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))
```
