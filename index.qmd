Hi there! Welcome to my **ISSS626 Geospatial Analytics homepage**!

Iâ€™m Sei Sar, a Master of IT in Business student at SMU. This website highlights my journey in learning Geospatial Analytics under the guidance of Professor Kam Tim Seong. The course features Hands-on Exercises, In-class Exercises, and Take Home Assignments that provide practical experience and deepen my understanding of this exciting new field that I am exploring. In this website, you will find my coursework prepared for this course.

I developed this site using R-Studio, and you can explore my work further on my GitHub repository: [ssrhk/ISSS626-GAA](https://github.com/ssrhk/ISSS626-GAA). Thank you for visiting!
