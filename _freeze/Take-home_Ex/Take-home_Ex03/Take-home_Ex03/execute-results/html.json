In Tanzania, financial inclusion initiatives have become a priority in addressing the needs of underserved populations, particularly those in rural or economically disadvantaged areas. These initiatives aim to improve household incomes, reduce income inequality, and foster inclusive economic participation by providing timely and affordable access to financial products and services(United Nations Capital Development Fund \\[UNCDF\\], 2024).\n\nDespite significant progress in financial inclusion efforts, access to financial services is uneven across different geographical regions within Tanzania. Rural areas, particularly in districts with low levels of economic activity, often face greater challenges in accessing financial services compared to more urbanized districts. These spatial disparities raise important questions about the factors driving financial inclusion at the district level and how regional policies can be designed to promote more inclusive economic outcomes.\n\n## 1.2 Objectives\n\nThis analysis aims to build an explanatory model using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to identify the key factors affecting financial inclusion across districts in Tanzania. By focusing on multiple socio-economic and infrastructural variables, this study will provide insights into how these factors vary geographically and influence financial access at a district level.\n\nSpecifically, the objectives are:\n\n-   **Identify Key Determinants**: Determine the primary socio-economic and infrastructural factors that influence financial inclusion, such as income levels, education, proximity to financial institutions, and mobile money adoption.\n\n-   **Examine Regional Variation**: Explore how the effects of these factors vary across different districts, providing a localized understanding of financial inclusion.\n\n## 1.3 Defining Financial Inclusion\n\nFinancial inclusion refers to the process of ensuring that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs such as transactions, payments, savings, credit, and insurance. According to the World Bank, financial inclusion is a \"key enabler in reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity by providing the unbanked and underserved populations access to essential financial services\" (World Bank, 2023).\n\nA well-functioning financial inclusion system enables individuals to manage risks, invest in education, and build sustainable livelihoods. In the context of Tanzania, financial inclusion is particularly vital for rural populations, where access to traditional banking infrastructure is limited, and reliance on informal financial services can hinder economic opportunities. The development of digital financial services, such as mobile money, has significantly expanded financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa, enabling millions to access financial services without needing to visit a physical bank (World Bank Group, 2024).\n\nWhile progress has been made, the uneven distribution of financial services and the varying levels of inclusion between rural and urban areas highlight the need to explore the determinants of financial inclusion at a local level. Identifying these factors is crucial for improving access to financial services and promoting inclusive economic development.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2 Methodology\n\nThe explanatory model will be developed using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), which is a spatial extension of multiple linear regression that allows for localized variations in the relationships between predictors and the response variable—in this case, financial inclusion.\n\nThe process will follow these steps:\n\n-   **Variable Selection**: Identify key predictor variables from the FinScope dataset, such as income levels, education, proximity to financial institutions, population density, and mobile money adoption. These will serve as explanatory variables in the model.\n\n-   **Model Building**: Build the explanatory model using multiple linear regression techniques, enhanced by GWR to account for geographical variations. This will allow us to evaluate the influence of each predictor on financial inclusion across different districts.\n\n-   **Model Calibration and Validation**: Calibrate the GWR model to ensure that it effectively captures the localized relationships between financial inclusion and its determinants. The model will be validated by examining the accuracy and goodness-of-fit metrics.\n\n-   **Spatial Visualization**: Mapping the results of the GWR model to visualize how the effects of each factor vary geographically, will highlight districts where specific variables have a stronger or weaker influence on financial inclusion.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# 3 Loading R Packages\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Packages Used\n\nThe following packages were used for this

we will use two primary datasets: (1) FinScope Tanzania 2023, which provides district-level data on financial inclusion, and (2) district-level boundary GIS data from the geoBoundaries portal to facilitate spatial analysis.\n\n-   **FinScope Tanzania 2023**: This dataset include comprehensive district-level data on access to financial services, covering indicators such as banking services, mobile money usage, savings, loans, and insurance. The dataset will be used to identify the key factors affecting financial inclusion and to develop the explanatory model.\n\n-   **District Boundary GIS Data**: Geographic boundary data for the districts of Tanzania, sourced from the geoBoundaries, will enable us to link the financial inclusion data to specific geographic locations for spatial analysis using GWR.\n\n## 4.2 Import the Data\n\n### 4.2.1 Aspatial Data\n\nThe *FinScope* *Tanzania* dataset from 2023, was imported by using *read_csv()* package.\n\nThen, the data was prepared for analysis with the following steps:\n\n-   Remove columns with all missing/NA values.\n-   Then we select the columns with the variables chosen which will be explained in the Variable Selection section.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntanzania <- read_csv(\"data/rawdata/FinScope_Tanzania.csv\")%>%\n  select(5,9,11,13:14,16,61,65:67,71,95:96,98:103,107:119,124:125,140,142:151,160:174,177:178,188,183:192,196,215:223,\n         276:278,294:306,344:353,361:372,374:378,395:397,455:460,507:529,574:588,680:685,697:698,700:716,718) %>%\n  select(where(~ !all(is.na(.))))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will use ***glimpse()*** to quickly check the attributes.\n\nLastly, we will save the prepared dataframe into rds format.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Save\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite_rds(tanzania, \"data/rds/tanzania.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Load\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntanzania <- read_rds(\"data/rds/tanzania.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### 4.2.2 Geospatial Data - Study Area\n\nThe *geo Boundaries of Tanzania* dataset, was imported by using *st_read()* package.\n\nThe dataset was prepared for analysis with the following steps:\n\n-   We note that Tanzania is in WGS 84/ UTM Zone 37S. We will use st_transform to reproject coordinate reference system to EPSG: 32737 for Tanzania.\n\n-   To perform left join with the aspatial dataset, we need a common column - districts. Therefore, we need to change the variable, shapeName, to 'dist_name' to make it a common variable with the FinScope Tanzania dataset.\n\n-   To ensure the districts are common, some districts will be renamed from \"Arusha Urban\" to \"Arusha\" as the same way it was displayed in FinScope Tanzania dataset. Since the FinScope Tanzania dataset already have a variable that classifies if the surveyee is residing in an urban or rural area, we do not need to have a separate district with the title Urban as it falls under the same district.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntanzbounds <- st_read(dsn = \"data/rawdata/\", \n                      layer = \"geoBoundaries-TZA-ADM2\",\n

This section focuses on the identification and selection of both nominal and continuous variables that will serve as predictors in our regression analysis.\n\nInitially, we will establish a preliminary set of variables based on theoretical foundations and previous empirical research. Nominal variables will encompass categorical factors that may influence financial behaviors, such as the type of financial institution, demographic characteristics, and access to financial services. Continuous variables will include measurable factors like amount borrowed, and age which can provide insight into the financial landscape of the respondents.\n\nOnce we have constructed our initial model using these variables, we will conduct a comprehensive model assessment to evaluate its performance. This will involve calculating the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to assess multicollinearity among the independent variables. High VIF values indicate potential redundancy among variables, which can compromise the model's reliability. Consequently, we will refine our variable selection by identifying and retaining only those variables that significantly contribute to explaining the variance in our dependent variable, financial inclusion.\n\n## 5.1 Continuous Variables\n\nThe following are the continuous variables selected.\n\n+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Variable**                           | **Justification for Selection**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n+========================================+=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+\n| Age                                    | Age is a critical demographic variable that often influences various socio-economic outcomes.
