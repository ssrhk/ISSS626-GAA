It is especially important in developing regions where the unbanked population faces limited access to formal financial products, which constrains their ability to save, invest, and secure insurance, leading to income inequality. In this study, we aim to explore the factors that influence financial inclusion at the district level in Tanzania using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) methods.\n\nGWR is a powerful spatial analysis tool that accounts for geographical variability in relationships between predictor variables and financial inclusion, providing localized insights into how different factors affect access to financial services across districts.\n\n## 1.2 Objectives\n\nThe primary goal of this analysis is to identify and examine the key indicators of financial inclusion in Tanzania.\n\n## 1.3 Defining Financial Inclusion\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2 Loading R Packages\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Packages Used\n\nThe following packages were used for this study:\n\n| Package   | Description                                           |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| tidyverse | For non-spatial data wrangling                        |\n| corrplot  | For correlation analysis among chosen variables       |\n| sf        | For importing, managing, and handling geospatial data |\n| sfdep     | To derive tourism economy indicator layer             |\n| tmap      | For visualizing maps                                  |\n| ggplot2   | To visualize other statistics                         |\n|           |                                                       |\n|           |                                                       |\n\n## Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(olsrr, ggstatsplot, ggpubr, sf, spdep, sfdep, GWmodel, tmap, tidyverse, gtsummary,see,performance,datawizard)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# 3 Data Preparation\n\n## 3.1 The Datasets\n\nFor the purpose of this analysis,\n\n1.  *FinScope* *Tanzania* (2023) from\n2.  **geoBoundaries** of Tanzania from\n\n## 3.2 Import the Data\n\n### 3.2.1 Aspatial Data\n\nThe *FinScope* *Tanzania* dataset from 2023, was imported by using *read_csv()* package.\n\nThen, the data was prepared for analysis with the following steps:\n\n-   Remove columns with all missing/NA values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntanzania <- read_csv(\"data/rawdata/FinScope_Tanzania.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will use ***glimpse()*** to quickly check the attributes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(tanzania)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 9,915\nColumns: 721\n$ `Serial Number`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <dbl> …\n$ reg_name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <chr> …\n$ reg_code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <dbl> …\n$ dist_code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <dbl> …\n$ dist_name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <chr> …\n$ ward_code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <dbl> …\n$ ward_name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <chr> …\n$ ea_code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <dbl> …\n$ `Cluster type`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <chr> …\n$ `C1.
